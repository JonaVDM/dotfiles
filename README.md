# Dotfiles

# Setup
Did not have a change to check if setup is actually working,
but it is there for now.
```bash
sh ./setup.sh
```

## Docker
I have uploaded a version of my dotfiles do docker hub. So if you for some
reason want to try them, simply run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it jonavdm/dev-env
```

(The download is like a gb or so, don't say I didn't warn you)
